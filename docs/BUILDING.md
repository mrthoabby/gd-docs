## Prerequisites

AFFiNE client has both **Node.js** & **Rust** toolchains.

### Install Node.js

We suggest develop our product under node.js LTS(Long-term support) version

#### Option 1: Manually install node.js

install [Node LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

> Up to now, the major node.js version is 20.x

#### Option 2: Use node version manager

install [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

```sh
fnm use
```

### Install Rust Tools

Please follow the official guide at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

### Setup Node.js Environment

This setup requires modern yarn (currently `4.x`), run this if your yarn version is `1.x`

Reference: [Yarn installation doc](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
```

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Clone repository

#### Linux & MacOS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE
```

#### Windows

In our codebase, we use symbolic links. Due to the security design of Windows, the creation of symbolic links requires administrator privileges. This is part of the security policy settings of Windows, and more information can be found at [Security Policy Settings for Creating Symbolic Links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links).

For detailed guidance on enabling this feature, please refer to the official documentation: [Enable Developer Mode on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development).

Once Developer Mode is enabled, execute the following command with administrator privileges:

```sh
# Enable symbolic links
git config --global core.symlinks true
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE
```

## Testing

Adding test cases is strongly encouraged when you contribute new features and bug fixes.
